        She didn't like the food. She never did. She made the usual complaints
        and started the tantrum he knew was coming. But this time was different.
        Instead of trying to placate her and her unreasonable demands, he just
        stared at her and watched her meltdown without saying a word. He looked
        at the sand. Picking up a handful, he wondered how many grains were in
        his hand. Hundreds of thousands? "Not enough," the said under his
        breath. I need more. It went through such rapid contortions that the
        little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became
        confused in the darkness, and could not, for the life of him, tell
        whether he held the sheep right side up, or upside down. But that point
        was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself, who, with a
        sudden twist, jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave
        a grunt of anger and disgust. It was the first day of the rest of her
        life. This wasn't the day she was actually born, but she knew that
        nothing would be the same from this day forward. Although this was a bit
        scary to her, it was also extremely freeing. Her past was no longer a
        burden or something that she needed to be concerned about and defend.
        She threw off the covers keeping her warm in bed, placed her feet over
        the side of the bed, slipped on her slipper, and took the first step of
        the first day of her new life
