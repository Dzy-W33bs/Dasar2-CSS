            <p id="p1">She didn't like the food. She never did. She made the usual complaints
                and started the tantrum he knew was coming. But this time was different.
                Instead of trying to placate her and her unreasonable demands, he just
                stared at her and watched her meltdown without saying a word. He looked
                at the sand. Picking up a handful, he wondered how many grains were in
                his hand. Hundreds of thousands? "Not enough," the said under his
                breath. I need more. It went through such rapid contortions that the
                little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became
                confused in the darkness, and could not, for the life of him, tell
                whether he held the sheep right side up, or upside down. But that point
                was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself, who, with a
                sudden twist, jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave
                a grunt of anger and disgust. It was the first day of the rest of her
                life. This wasn't the day she was actually born, but she knew that
                nothing would be the same from this day forward. Although this was a bit
                scary to her, it was also extremely freeing. Her past was no longer a
                burden or something that she needed to be concerned about and defend.
                She threw off the covers keeping her warm in bed, placed her feet over
                the side of the bed, slipped on her slipper, and took the first step of
                the first day of her new life</p>
